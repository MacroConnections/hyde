title: Applied Data Visualization
---

## Course Description
Meaning in data is only revealed to those who can bring it to life. With the continual rise of data availability and adoption, the need for sound training in visualization is increasingly important.

Applied Data Visualization is a course designed to equip students with the theoretical and practical tools needed to build effective and engaging data visualizations. By the end of the semester, we aim for students to feel comfortable designing and developing visual stories with data.

Students are expected to critically discuss weekly readings, give and receive peer feedback, and learn while doing. The final course deliverable is a publication- or release-quality visualization project.

No experience with visualization or programming is necessary. Experience with front-end web development (HTML/CSS/JS), visualization and interface design, and software development processes would help.
