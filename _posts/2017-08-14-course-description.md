title: Applied Data Visualization
---

## Course Description
Meaning in data is only revealed to those who can bring it to life. With the continual rise in data availability and adoption, the need for sound training in visualization is increasingly important. How can be maximize clarity and precision without losing beauty? How we can take advantage of graphical perception in designing visualizations? How should we build in interaction?

Applied Data Visualization is a course designed to give the conceptual and practical tools to build powerful data visualizations with modern web technologies. At the end of the course, we aim for students to feel comfortable turning hypotheses or datasets into visualizations.

The final deliverable is a publication-quality or release-quality visualization project. Students are expected to participate in discussions, productively give and receive feedback with peers, and be enthusiastic about learning.

No experience with visualization or programming is necessary. Experience with front-end web development (HTML/CSS/JS), visualization and interface design, and software development processes would help.
